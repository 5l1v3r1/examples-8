Morph-images
===========
This example demonstrates using openFrameworks and OpenCL
for morphing between two color images.
Each image is represented as a 1 million of color particles;
for morphing each particle gets its target position and color and morph to it.

Here morphing is performed not in linear fashion, but in polar coordinates,
so particles move in circular fashion.
